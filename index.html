                    I'm a Ph.D student (Fall 2022) in the School of Computing at the University of Utah, advised by 
                    <a href="http://www.cemyuksel.com">Prof. Cem Yuksel.</a>
                    Before I started my Ph.D study, I worked as a software engineer in a game company, 
                    <a href="https://twitter.com/Seasungames/with_replies">Seasun Games,</a>
                    in China for 2.5 years. I obtain my master's degree in the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2019 and bachlor's degree in the Zhejiang Sci-Tech University in 2016. 
                    Now, my research focus on water wave simulation. In addition, I'm also interested in rendering and geometry.

                    When I'm free, I'm a girl addicted to video games! When I was young, I regarded game-related technical research as my lifetime dream and goal. 
                    This is the reason why I choose Computer Science as my major and study for Ph.D. I enjoy playing 3A games. You can see my full achievements in the Sekiro：Shadows Die Twice.
